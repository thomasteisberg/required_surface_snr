# Required Surface SNR

## Description 

This repo contains tool and scripts developed to analyze surface signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from CReSIS and UTIG data. The project includes the following componenets: 

**snr_finder.py:** This script is designed to process radar data from .csv and .mat files to calculate the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each data point from the CReSIS data. This script is particularly useful for geophysical applications where radar data needs to be analyzed to assess signal quality.
